Feel free to play around with the database and user login stuff. Since I didn't upload the test database I was using, you'll have to make your own: just run 'python db_create.py' in the terminal, and that should do it. Then you should be create new users with the url '/new_account' and log them in and out with '/login' and '/logout'.

Things that could be done: 

the about, terms, contact, and feedback pages linked to at the bottom of each page don't actually exist, so those could be made.

There's no sell page.

Also no 'your account' page.

Not sure exactly what else there is to be done right now. Feel free to play around and do stuff you think would be cool.

I'll try to get the actual listings working soon so we can actually create new ones and have them display and junk.
